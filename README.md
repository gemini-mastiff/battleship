# Battleship

This basic Battleship game was built as part of my journey to practice JavaScript logic, DOM manipulation, and Webpack bundling.
It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive grid-based gameplay experience where ships are randomly placed. The game features turn-based logic to detect hits, misses, and determine the winner.

## Features

- Randomized ship placement at the start of each game (no drag-and-drop).
- Turn-based gameplay where the player guesses ship positions.
- Logic for tracking hits, misses, and sunk ships.
- Responsive, clean interface styled with CSS.

## Getting Started

Clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:gemini-mastiff/battleship.git
    cd battleship

Install the dependencies:

    npm install

Run the local server:

    npm run dev

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Webpack

## Notes

No drag-and-drop functionality for ship placement (planned for future improvements).

This is a simple, minimal implementation designed for learning.
