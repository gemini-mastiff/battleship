# Battleship

This is a basic Battleship game implemented as a web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The ships are randomly placed on the board, and the gameplay features a simple loop with logic to handle turns, determine hits or misses, and ultimately decide the winner.

## Features

- Randomized ship placement on the grid (no drag-and-drop).
- Simple gameplay loop allowing the player to guess positions.
- Basic logic for hits, misses, and sinking ships.
- Responsive and clean interface using CSS.

## Getting Started

    git clone git@github.com:gemini-mastiff/battleship.git
    cd battleship
    npm install
    npm run dev

## Notes

No drag-and-drop functionality for ship placement (planned for future improvements).

This is a simple, minimal implementation designed for learning.
